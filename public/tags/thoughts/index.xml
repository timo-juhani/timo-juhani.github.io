      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s better to fail early than avoid the bitter taste of defeat until the
very last moment. It&amp;rsquo;s common to lead a self-talk that is based on untested
capabilities and knowledge. When combined imagination and lack of context create
a mind trap in which you may believe to be unbeatable but in fact are in the
most vulnerable position when the moment of truth comes. It&amp;rsquo;s a very dangerous
mind trap. Training and education should be intense, close to real life and
present challenging scenario based situations - that sometimes has been designed
to offer nothing but defeat. Failure teaches. Success inflates the ego,
but as soon as it burst you find only emptiness. Go for the failure so that
performance comes easier when its needed. Know your limits and then expand them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
