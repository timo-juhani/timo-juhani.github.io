      <description>&lt;p&gt;Patching your infrastructure is one of the best ways to have a huge impact on your security posture. While this is undebateble fact and while some organizations have this under control many still struggle to keep up with the emerging vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a response to an alarming state of how many networks still run unpatched and the growing number of network exploits I created this
project called LAN Upgrade. As of today it&amp;rsquo;s capable of patching IOS-XE switches (and possibly routers -&amp;gt; needs to be tested) in mass and
in parallel saving a lot of time and money while reaching the objective of running safe and up to date network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
