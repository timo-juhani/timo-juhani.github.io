Sending and receiving LTE calls, messages and data without terrestrial LTE base stations is possible. Starlink has launched a service called Direct to Cell which works on any LTE handset. In their architecture the satellite works as an eNodeB which can be then integrated to a wider network and roaming partners.

This could be a start of something new. Time will tell.
