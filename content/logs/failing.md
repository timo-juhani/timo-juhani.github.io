It's better to fail early than avoid the bitter taste of defeat until the 
very last moment. It's common to lead a self-talk that is based on untested 
capabilities and knowledge. When combined imagination and lack of context create
a mind trap in which you may believe to be unbeatable but in fact are in the 
most vulnerable position when the moment of truth comes. It's a very dangerous 
mind trap. Training and education should be intense, close to real life and 
present challenging scenario based situations - that sometimes has been designed
to offer nothing but defeat. Failure teaches. Success inflates the ego, 
but as soon as it burst you find only emptiness. Go for the failure so that 
performance comes easier when its needed. Know your limits and then expand them.
