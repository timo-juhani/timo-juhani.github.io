Patching your infrastructure is one of the best ways to have a huge impact on your security posture. While this is undebateble fact and while some organizations have this under control many still struggle to keep up with the emerging vulnerabilities.

As a response to an alarming state of how many networks still run unpatched and the growing number of network exploits I created this
project called LAN Upgrade. As of today it's capable of patching IOS-XE switches (and possibly routers -> needs to be tested) in mass and 
in parallel saving a lot of time and money while reaching the objective of running safe and up to date network. 

The project is based on Python, expects only SSH connection from network devices and is easy to learn by anyone who has some experience on Linux shell and networking equipment.
